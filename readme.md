# Code Context Manager

## Description
The Code Context Manager is a Python project that provides a comprehensive set of classes and tools for managing code context. The project includes classes to represent and manipulate code elements, directory structures, version control, project configurations, issue tracking, testing, and dependencies. The codebase is designed to be modular, allowing developers to create, analyze, and manipulate code context in a structured manner.

## Features
- Code Context: Create and manage the context of code projects, including variables, functions, and classes.
- Language Context: Define language-specific contexts and manage language-related data.
- Directory Structure: Manage hierarchical directory structures and files.
- Project Configuration: Set and retrieve project-specific configurations, such as compiler options.
- Version Control: Simulate version control operations like branching and committing.
- Issue Tracking: Create and manage issues with an issue tracker.
- Test Suite: Add and manage test cases in a test suite.
- Dependencies: Manage project dependencies and library versions.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone [https://github.com/DvegaDv01/code-context.git]

## Usage
The Code Context Manager provides a variety of classes to manage different aspects of code context. Below is a basic example of how to use the CodeContext class:

```python
from core.code_context import CodeContext

# Create a CodeContext instance for a Python project
code_context = CodeContext(language="Python")

# Create a directory structure with subdirectories and files
src_dir = code_context.create_directory("src")
main_file = code_context.create_file("main.py", parent_path="src")

# Add code elements to the main file
main_file.add_variable("x", "int")
main_file.add_function("main", "def main():")

# Set project configurations
code_context.project_config.set_compiler_options("python3")

# Use version control to create a branch and commit changes
code_context.version_control.create_branch("feature1")
code_context.version_control.commit_changes("Initial commit")

# Add a dependency to the project
code_context.add_dependency("numpy", "1.21.0")
